Description: An all-encompassing R toolkit designed to streamline the
    process of calling various bioinformatics software and then performing data
    analysis and visualization in R. With 'blit', users can easily integrate a
    wide array of bioinformatics command line tools into their workflows,
    leveraging the power of R for sophisticated data manipulation and graphical
    representation.
